# Vehicle-Price-Prediction
I am predicting vehicle prices based on various parameters. I have built a decision tree model, which has shown good accuracy. With the additional data I have obtained, I will be working on AdaBoost Regression next.

Given that the vehicle market is volatile and subject to daily changes, many websites and apps use similar models to estimate probable vehicle prices. My model aims to enhance these predictions by incorporating more accurate algorithms and data insights.
